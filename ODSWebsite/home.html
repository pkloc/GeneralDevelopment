	</header>
    
    <p>Orchesis is a modern and jazz dance program offered through the University of Alberta - Campus Recreation to dancers of all abilities and experience. 
		Registration is open to the students, public and alumni.</p>
    
    <p>Those who register in any of Orchesis Modern Dance Classes participate in dance training through weekly modern and jazz dance classes. Modern dance 
		classes cover various technical styles of modern dance with floorwork, barre exercises and traveling movement phrases, accompanied by live musicians. 
        Jazz classes emphasize the practice and perfecting of technique, within the jazz idiom.  All classes consist of preparatory exercises, locomotor work 
		across the floor, stretching and the learning of dance phrase combinations.</p>

		talent.  There is an optional performance opportunity for those who register for the ANNUAL membership.  Registrants who sign up for one term only
